\chapter{Approach}\label{chapter:approach}
The research question studied in this thesis is the prototypical implementation of heuristics to detect generated code which use techniques of clone detection on the comments that are extracted from the source code. A list of heuristics that detect generated code of several code generators will be derived by means of the comments. Therefore a generator pattern repository will be created. The target of this repository is to provide a database of code generators and their respective characteristic generator pattern which identifies the source code containing it as generated.
\section{Use Teamscale as lexer to extract Tokens}
The first step in the approach used in this paper is the lexical analysis of the source code included in the projects used as a benchmark. Teamscale comes with a multitude of lexers applicable for many different programming languages. These
