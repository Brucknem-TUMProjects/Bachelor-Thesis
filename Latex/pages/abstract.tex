A suffix-tree clone-detection approach to find clones among the comments in source code files is presented. Using this approach we found a multitude of generator-patterns that are inserted by their respective code generator and identify the source code file as generated. \\
We extracted the patterns to build up a generator-pattern repository that can be used to automatically classify code into the categories \textit{generated} and \textit{manually maintained}. This repository is used on a reference data set and a huge, randomly composed collection of open source projects to test its capabilities and to calculate different proportions of generated code.
