My thanks go to my mentor Dr.~Alexander~von~Rhein and my advisor Dr. Elmar JÃ¼rgens for always supporting me at all phases of this thesis. Additionally I thank the CQSE~GmbH for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis in an environment where I could bring in my own ideas and could always rely on a highly competent team. Further I thank Prof. Dr. Manfred Broy for supervising me on this fascinating topic.
